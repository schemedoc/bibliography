(abstract "Termite Scheme is a variant of Scheme intended for distributed computing. It offers a simple and powerful concurrency model, inspired by the Erlang programming language, which is based on a message-passing model of concurrency." "Our system is well suited for building custom protocols and abstractions for distributed computation. Its open network model allows for the building of non-centralized distributed applications." "The possibility of failure is reflected in the model, and ways to handle failure are available in the language. We exploit the existence of first class continuations in order to allow the expression of high-level concepts such as process migration." "We describe the Termite model and its implications, how it compares to Erlang, and describe sample applications built with Termite. We conclude with a discussion of the current implementation and its performance.")

(abstract "The transfer of program data between the nodes of a distributed system is a fundamental operation. It usually requires some form of data serialization. For a functional language such as Scheme it is clearly desirable to also allow the unrestricted transfer of functions between nodes. With the goal of developing a portable implementation of the Termite system we have designed the Mobit Scheme interpreter which supports unrestricted serialization of Scheme objects, including procedures and continuations. Mobit is derived from an existing Scheme in Scheme fast interpreter. We demonstrate how macros were valuable in transforming the interpreter while preserving its structure and maintainability. Our performance evaluation shows that the run time speed of Mobit is comparable to existing Scheme interpreters.")

(abstract "This dissertation makes four contributions towards supporting distributed, multiuser applications over open networks." "Dreme, a distributed dialect of the Scheme language in which all first-class language objects are mobile in the network. In particular, various distributed topologies, such as client/server and peer-to-peer, can be created by migrating closures with overlapping scopes around the network, correct inter-process communication being assured by Scheme's lexical scoping rules and network wide addressing. Threads of control are passed around through first-class distributed continuations." "A User Interface toolkit for coordinating events in multi-threaded, multi-user applications by organizing continuation callbacks into nested lexical scopes. Each event has certain attributes, such as synchronous/asynchronous. Certain events create new scopes with new events. Continuation callbacks allow both synchronous events which return values to their callers, and asynchronous ones. Application needn't be spread throughout the application, as with applications using an event-loop." "A distributed garbage collection algorithm that collects all cycles on an open network. The basic algorithm depends on maintaining the inverse reference graph (IRG) among network nodes (i.e., if a->b is in the regular graph, b->a is in the IRG). A single IRG traversal from any object determines the status of each object touched. Communication is decentralized (any object can choose to determine its status), garbage is touched O(1) times (in the absence of failures), it is fault-tolerant, and can handle malicious or faulty neighbors. Each operation uses messages linear in the size of the IRG. Overlapping operations perform like parallel quick sort." "An approach to using the Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML) over the network to support distributed GUIs, intelligent clients, and mobile agents. SGML is a meta-grammar for creating domain specific document markup languages to which a variety of semantics (display, reading/writing databases, etc.) can be applied. The document, its grammar, and some semantics, are retrieved over the network. Applications normally create interfaces directly out of graphic objects to communicate with the user. However, if the interface has some semantics (and is parsable), a computational agent can interpret the interface and talk directly to the application on behalf of the human.")

(abstract "Linear graph reduction is a simple computational model in which the cost of naming things is explicitly represented. The key idea is the notion of linearity. A name is linear if it is only used once, so with linear naming you cannot create more than one outstanding reference to an entity. As a result, linear naming is cheap to support and easy to reason about." "Programs can be translated into the linear graph reduction model such that linear names in the program are implemented directly as linear names in the model. Nonlinear names are supported by constructing them out of linear names. The translation thus exposes those places where the program uses names in expensive, nonlinear ways." "Two applications demonstrate the utility of using linear graph reduction: First, in the area of distributed computing, linear naming makes it easy to support cheap cross-network references and highly portable data structures, Linear naming also facilitates demand driven migration of tasks and data around the network without requiring explicit guidance from the programmer." "Second, linear graph reduction reveals a new characterization of the phenomenon of state. Systems in which state appears are those which depend on certain global system properties. State is not a localizable phenomenon, which suggests that our usual object oriented metaphor for state is awed.")

(abstract "This paper describes the semantics of Quantum, a language that was specifically designed to control resource consumption of distributed computations, such as mobile agent style applications. In Quantum, computations can be driven by mastering their resource consumption. Resources can be understood as processors cycles, geographical expansion, bandwidth or duration of communications, etc. We adopt a generic view by saying that computations need energy to be performed. Quantum relies on three new primitives that deal with energy. The first primitive creates a tank of energy associated with a computation. Asynchronous notifications inform the user of energy exhaustion and computation termination. The other two primitives allow us to implement suspension and resumption of computations by emptying a tank and by supplying more energy to a tank. The semantics takes the form of an abstract machine with explicit parallelism and energy-related primitives.")

(abstract "The network now gives the opportunity to combine code and data from everywhere in the world. However, the dominant paradigm is the client/server model where immobile objects with static interfaces can only be used as prescribed by their proprietary site. While this constraint corresponds to understandable industrial programming practices, it negates the point of view of dynamic clients that collect interesting objects and want to confer new behaviors to these collected objects. How to enrich objects \"from the outside\" that is, without access to their source code hence without re-compilation of their defining classes, is the problem addressed by this paper." "Generic functions, à la CLOS, separate classes from behaviors i.e., methods. Roughly said, a generic function is a bag of methods; when a generic function is invoked, the nature (type, class or, structure) of its argument(s) triggers the choice of an appropriate method. Methods are no longer the exclusive property of classes, they are regular functions anyone may define outside classes definitions." "This paper describes how generic functions may be conveniently and not so inefficiently implemented in a distributed world. Section 1 presents some of the constraints of distributed systems. Section 2 recalls the framework of generic functions as well as how we extend them to the distributed world. Significantly, we address the problem of mutual recursion over a bag of methods to which new methods may be adjoined at run-time. We also propose a new feature: call-former-method. Section 3 discusses implementation while Section 4 eventually discusses the incorporation of these results in a real system.")

We explicitly show how common parallel constructs can be written in regular CD-Scheme."

"The TransPive message passing primitives create the remote pointers, with local caches for the object's value (to improve performance of read accesses). A protocol to invalidate the caches is invoked when a modifier is applied. A Distributed Garbage Collector is included on TransPive to reclaim distant pointed objects. A simple mechanism to distribute the computation over the system is also provided."

(abstract "Coordination languages for parallel and distributed systems specify mechanisms for creating tasks and communicating data among them. These languages typically assume that (a) once a task begins execution on some processor, it will remain resident on that processor throughout its lifetime, and (b) communicating shared data among tasks is through some form of message-passing and data migration. In this paper, we investigate an alternative approach to understanding coordination. Communication-passing style (CmPS) refers to a coordination semantics in which data communication is always undertaken by migrating the continuation of the task requiring the data to the processor where the data resides." "Communication-passing style is closely related to continuation-passing style (CPS), a useful transformation for compiling functional languages. Just as CPS eliminates implicit call-return sequences, CmPS eliminates implicit inter-processor data communication and synchronization requests. In a CmPS-transformed program, only continuations (i.e., control contexts) are transmitted across machines; all synchronization and data communication occurs locally. Besides providing significant optimization opportunities, CmPS is a natural representation for implementations on networks of workstations." "This paper presents an operational semantics for a coordination language that supports first-class distributed data repositories. The computation sublanguage considered is an untyped call-by-value functional language similar to pure Scheme. Optimizations and implementation issues that arise from using a CmPS-driven coordination language are also described.")

The algorithm is formalised by an abstract machine and is proved to be correct. The safety property ensures that an object may not be reclaimed as long as it is referred to locally or remotely. The liveness property guarantees that unreachable objects will eventually be reclaimed. The mobility property certifies that messages are always forwarded towards more recent mobile object positions.")

(abstract "Massively distributed computing is a challenging problem for garbage collection algorithm designers as it raises the issue of scalability. The high number of hosts involved in a computation can require large tables for reference listing, whereas the lack of information sharing between hosts in a same locality can entail redundant GC traffic. In this paper, we argue that a conceptual hierarchical organisation of massive distributed computations can solve this problem. By conceptual hierarchical organisation, we mean that processors are still able to communicate in a peer to peer manner using their usual communication mechanism, but GC messages will be routed as if processors were organised in hierarchy. We present an extension of a distributed reference counting algorithm that uses such a hierarchical organisation. It allows us to bound table sizes by the number of hosts in a domain, and it allows us to share GC information between hosts in a same locality in order to reduce cross-network GC traffic.")

(abstract "This report describes an implementation of a distributed software transactional memory (DSTM) system in PLT Scheme. The system is built using PLT Scheme's Unit construct to encapsulate the various concerns of the system, and allow for multiple communication layer backends. The front-end API exposes true parallel processing to PLT Scheme programmers, as well as cluster-based computing using a shared namespace for transactional variables. The ramifications of the availability of such a system are considered in the novel context of highly dynamic robot swarm programming scenarios. In robotics programming scenarios, difficulty with expressing complex distributed computing patterns often supersedes raw performance in importance. In fact, for many applications the data to be shared among networked peers is relatively small in size, but the manner in which data sharing is expressed leads to tremendous inefficiencies both at development time and runtime. In an effort to maintain focus on behavior specification, we reduce the emphasis on messaging protocols typically found in distributed robotics software, while providing even greater flexibility in terms of how data is mixed and matched as it moves over the network.")

(abstract "Software transactions are a promising technology that make writing correct and efficient shared-memory multithreaded programs easier, but adding transactions to programming languages requires defining and implementing how they interact with existing language features. In this work, we consider how transactions interact with first-class continuations. We demonstrate that different idiomatic uses of continuations require different transactional semantics, so a language supporting transactions and call-with-current-continuation should provide programmers with a way to control these semantics. We present a design meeting this need, addressing both escaping from and reentering the dynamic extent of a transaction. We have implemented our design by modifying Scheme48. We present the most interesting details of the implementation and its performance on some small benchmarks.")

Amongst the many factors contributing to this complexity, the nondeterminacy of these systems is an important one. Execution replay is a technique developed to facilitate the debugging of nondeterministic programs. Execution replay has very broad applications and not every algorithm is applicable in every situation. This taxonomy provides a precise classification of replay debuggers using nine criteria. From this classification, it is easier to determine a debugger's scope of application, outline its strengths and weaknesses and compare it with others. This taxonomy is illustrated and validated using a collection of existing replay debuggers.")

(abstract "Lazy task creation (LTC) is an efficient approach for executing divide and conquer parallel programs that has been used in the implementation of Multilisp's future construct. Unfortunately it requires a specialized memory management scheme, in particular for stack frames, which makes it hard to use in the context of conventional languages. We have designed a variant of LTC which has a stack management discipline that is compatible with the semantics of conventional languages. This mechanism, which we call lazy remote procedure call, has been used to implement a parallel variant of C. A first prototype of our system has been ported to shared-memory multiprocessors and network of workstations. Experimental results on a Cray T3D multiprocessor show that good performance can be achieved on several symbolic programs.")

(abstract "We present a new concurrency abstraction and implementation technique for high-level (symbolic) parallel languages that allows significant programmer control over load-balancing and mapping of fine-grained lightweight threads. Central to our proposal is the notion of a virtual topology. A virtual topology defines a relation over a collection of virtual processors, and a mapping of those processors to a set of physical processors; processor topologies configured as trees, graphs, butterflies, and meshes are some well-known examples. A virtual topology need not have any correlation with a physical one; it is intended to capture the interconnection structure best suited for a given algorithm. We consider a virtual processor to be an abstraction that defines scheduling, migration and load-balancing policies for the threads it executes. Thus, virtual topologies are intended to provide a simple, expressive and efficient high-level framework for defining complex thread/processor mappings that abstracts low-level details of a physical interconnection.")

(abstract "We describe a parallel object-oriented dialect of Scheme called TS/Scheme that provides a simple and expressive interface for building asynchronous parallel programs. The main component in TS/Scheme's coordination framework is an abstraction that serves the role of a distributed data structure. Distributed data structures are an extension of conventional data structures insofar as many tasks may simultaneously access and update their contents according to a well-defined serialization protocol. The semantics of these structures also specifies that consumers which attempt to access an as-of-yet undefined element are to block until a producer provides a value." "TS/Scheme permits the construction of two basic kinds of distributed data structures, those accessed by content, and those accessed by name. These structures can be further specialized and composed to yield a number of other synchronization abstractions. Our intention is to provide an efficient medium for expressing concurrency and synchronization that is amenable to modular programming, and which can be used to succinctly and efficiently describe a variety of diverse concurrency paradigms useful for parallel symbolic computing.")

(abstract "Temporal and spatial locality are signi cant concerns in the design and implementation of any realistic parallel or distributed computing system. Temporal locality is concerned with relations among objects that share similar lifetimes and birth dates; spatial locality is concerned with relations among ob jects that share information. Exploiting temporal locality can lead to improved memory behavior; exploiting spatial locality can lead to improved communication behavior. Linguistic, compiler, and runtime support for locality issues is especially important for unstructured symbolic computations in which lifetimes and sharing properties of ob jects are not readily apparent. Language abstractions for spatial and temporal locality include mechanisms for grouping related threads of control, allowing programs exibility to map computations onto virtual processors, reusing dynamic contexts efficiently, and permitting asynchronous garbage collection across multiple processors. These abstractions give users and implementations a large degree of mobility to exploit inherent locality properties found within many dynamic parallel applications. We have investigated a number of these abstractions within a high-level language framework and within compilers targeted for such a framework. In this paper, we discuss several of these abstractions and justify their importance")

In this paper, we consider semantic analysis techniques and runtime support mechanisms that can be used to make distributed data structures an efficient device in this regard. We consider a compiler/runtime system for a higher-order expression-based parallel language supporting distributed data structures that relies on (1) a type inference system to answer questions regarding how shared distributed ob jects should be represented and partitioned, and (2) a high-level runtime kernel to e ectively manage and schedule dynamically instantiated lightweight threads of control. We argue that a tightly integrated system of this kind can be used to efficiently implement a variety of ne-grained parallel applications.")

(abstract "A distributed data structure is an object which permits many producers to augment or modify its contents, and many consumers simultaneously to access its component elements. Synchronization is implicit in data structure access: a process that requests an element which has not yet been generated blocks until a producer creates it." "In this paper, we describe a parallel programming language (called T S) whose fundamental communication device is a significant generalization of the tuple-space distributed data structure found in the Linda coordination language. Our sequential base language is a dialect of Scheme." "Beyond the fact that T S is derived by incorporating a tuple-space coordination language into a higher-order computation language (i.e., Scheme), T S differs from other tuple-space languages in two important ways:" "* Tuple-spaces are first-class objects. They may be dynamically created, bound to names, passed as arguments to (or returned as results from) functions, and built into other data structures or tuples." "* The behavior of tuple-spaces may be customized. A tuple-space is manipulated via a policy closure that specifies its operational characteristics. The representation of policy closures take significant advantage of Scheme's support for higher-order functions; there is no fundamental extension to Scheme needed in order to support them." "We argue that rst-class customizable tuple-spaces provide an expressive and exible medium for building parallel programs in higher-order languages.")

Our proposed kernel language differs from other tuple-space languages insofar tuple-spaces are treated as true first-class objects. Moreover, we develop a formal framework for constructing an optimizing preprocessor for such a language. The semantic analysis is based on an inference engine that statically computes the set of tuples (and their structural attributes) that can occupy any given tuple-space. The inference system is non-trivial insofar as it operates in the presence of higher-order functions and non-at data structures (e.g, lists). The result of the inference procedure can be used to customize the representation of tuple-space objects.")

In this approach, thread communication and synchronization is achieved by means of special primitives called signals, which ease the debugging process.

(abstract "Multilisp is a version of the Lisp dialect Scheme extended with constructs for parallel execution. Like Scheme, Multilisp is oriented toward symbolic computation. Unlike some parallel programming languages, Multilisp incorporates constructs for causing side effects and for explicitly introducing parallelism. The potential complexity of dealing with side effects in a parallel context is mitigated by the nature of the parallelism constructs and by support for abstract data types: a recommended Multilisp programming style is presented which, if followed, should lead to highly parallel, easily understandable programs." "Multilisp is being implemented on the 32-processor Concert multiprocessor; however, it is ultimately intended for use on larger multiprocessors. The current implementation, called Concert Multilisp, is complete enough to run the Multilisp compiler itself and has been run on Concert prototypes including up to eight processors. Concert Multilisp uses novel techniques for task scheduling and garbage collection. The task scheduler helps control excessive resource utilization by means of an unfair scheduling policy; the garbage collector uses a multiprocessor algorithm based on the incremental garbage collector of Baker.")

(abstract "Many parallel algorithms are naturally expressed at a fine level of granularity, often finer than a MIMD parallel system can exploit efficiently. Most builders of parallel systems have looked to either the programmer or a parallelizing compiler to increase the granularity of such algorithms. In this paper we explore a third approach to the granularity problem by analyzing two strategies for combining parallel tasks dynamically at run-time. We reject the simpler load-based inlining method, where tasks are combined based on dynamic load level, in favor of the safer and more robust lazy task creation method, where tasks are created only retroactively as processing resources become available." "These strategies grew out of work on Mul-T, an efficient parallel implementation of Scheme, but could be used with other applicative languages as well. We describe our Mul-T implementations of lazy task creation for two contrasting machines, and present performance statistics which show the method's effectiveness. Lazy task creation allows efficient execution of naturally expressed algorithms of a substantially finer grain than possible with previous parallel Lisp systems.")

(abstract "Multilisp is an extension of Lisp (more specifically, of the Lisp dialect Scheme) with additional operators and additional semantics to deal with parallel execution. It is being implemented on the 32-processor Concert multiprocessor. The current implementation is complete enough to run the Multilisp compiler itself, and has been run on Concert prototypes including up to four processors. Novel techniques are used for task scheduling and garbage collection. The task scheduler helps control excessive resource utilization by means of an unfair scheduling policy: the garbage collector uses a multiprocessor algorithm modeled after the incremental garbage collector of Baker. A companion paper discusses language design issues relating to Multilisp.")

Multilisp has been implemented on Concert, a shared-memory muitiprocessor that uses a novel RingBus interconnection. Concert currently has 28 MC68000 processors, with a design goal of 32 processors. Several application programs have been developed and measured using Concert Multilisp.

(abstract "Massively parallel computers are built out of thousands conventional but powerful processors with independent memories. Very simple topologies mainly based on physical neighbourhood link these processors. The paper discusses extensions to the Scheme language in order to master such machines. Allowing arguments of functions to be concurrently evaluated introduces parallelism. Migration across the different processors is achieved through a remote evaluation mechanism. First-class continuations offering some semantical problems with respect to concurrency, we propose a neat semantics for them and then show how to build, in the language itself, advanced concurrent constructs such as futures. Eventually we comment some simulations, with various topologies and migration policies, which enables to appreciate our previous linguistical choices and confirms the viability of the model. Massively parallel computers [Hewitt 80, Dally et al. 89, Germain et al. 90] are large ensembles comprising thousands of conventional but powerful processors equipped with independent memories. Their total throughput confers them tremendous computing potential but they still remain to be tamed. Such machines usually have a crystalline structure where a processor is only connected to its neighbours. No direct global addressing is possible within such a machine: informations can only ow from processor to processor on a neighbourhood basis. For the same reason, there is no shared memory. Various topologies exist and mainly hypertorus [Hewitt 80]. Only simple topologies achieve scalability i.e. the possibility to make a machine grow by simple addition of processors without logical nor physical discontinuity. To realize a chip which can be directly interconnected in three dimensions seems to be now attainable [B'echennec89] and confers much value to the whole approach We follow two ideas, similar to these expressed by [Chien & Dally 89]. First, programming should be relatively easy i.e. the mental model of the computation on so many processors with so many processes must be very simple to be still understandable; second, the language must allow to express sufficient concurrency to utilize the machine. Similarly to Halstead [Halstead 85], we choose to stick to an already familiar algorithmic language: Scheme [Rees & Clinger 86]. We only slightly modify or extend it with the needed capabilities. This approach growing from a small, powerful and semantically clean basis is our preferred way to easily experiment new features. We also try, following the Scheme philosophy, to introduce the minimal capabilities to satisfy our goals. The modified semantics of Scheme allows to concurrently evaluate the terms composing functional applications. This induces programming style changes as well as a modification of the meaning of continuations. Since concurrency is only introduced on a local basis, a remote evaluation mechanism [Stamos & Gifford 90] makes computations ow over the whole machine. Computations migrate but objects still reside on their birth site. We retain the full capabilities of Scheme and, in particular, do not forbid side-effects nor first-class continuation. We thus stick to a very simple, even na've, model: it is our aim to demonstrate that this model is viable through a series of simulations with varying topologies and migration strategies. The paper is organized in two main parts. The first part (section 1) describe the linguistical side and presents the semantics of our modifications to Scheme. The second part collects and comments results of simulations made on machines presented in section 2. We prove the viability of the previous linguistical choices in section 3. Future (section 4) and related (section 5) works conclude the paper.")

(abstract "The Scheme language does not fully specify the semantics of combination: the evaluation order of the terms composing a combination is left indeterminate. We investigate in this paper a different semantics for Scheme where terms of combinations are evaluated concurrently. The resulting semantics models a language with concurrent threads sharing a common workspace. The semantics is given in terms of denotational semantics and uses resumptions as well as a choice operator: oneof which mimics a scheduler. An alternate definition for this operator lets appear the classical powerdomains. The main interest of this operator is to offer a formalization that can be read with an operational point of view while keeping a firm theoretical base." "Scheme also offers first class continuations with indefinite extent; we examine some semantics for continuations with respect to concurrency. Each of these semantics is a natural extension of the sequential case of regular Scheme. Still they strongly differ in their observed behaviours." "The resulting language, named PolyScheme, offers much of the features of current concurrent Lisp (or Scheme) dialects thanks to the sole extension of its combination semantics and without any explicit specialized construct dealing with concurrency.")

Sting is different from other operating systems in several respects. The basic concurrency objects in Sting, virtual processors and lightweight threads, are first class. They provide the user with a level of expressiveness and control unavailable in other operating systems. Thread scheduling and migration are completely customizable. This allows Sting to be used in real-time, interactive, and batch oriented operating environments.

This paper describes one of the important contributions of Sting - customizable policy management at both the kernel and user level of the operating system. Two well defined interfaces separate control issues from policy issues. These interfaces allow different, customized policy management modules to be implemented without changing the rest of the system. Customizable policy management makes Sting suitable for many different operating environments including real time, interactive, and computationally intensive. It also allows the user to choose or implement a policy management strategy that is best suited to a particular program.")

(abstract "We describe an approach to implementing a wide-range of concurrency paradigms in high-level (symbolic) programming languages. The focus of our discussion is sting, a dialect of Scheme, that supports lightweight threads of control and virtual processors as first-class objects. Given the significant degree to which the behavior of these objects may be customized, we can easily express a variety of concurrency paradigms and linguistic structures within a common framework without loss of efficiency. Unlike parallel systems that rely on operating system services for managing concurrency, sting implements concurrency management entirely in terms of Scheme objects and procedures. It, therefore, permits users to optimize the runtime behavior of their applications without requiring knowledge of the underlying runtime system. This paper concentrates on (a) the implications of the design for building asynchronous concurrency structures, (b) organizing large-scale concurrent computations, and (c) implementing robust programming environments for symbolic computing.")

STING is intended to be used as an operating system substrate for modern parallel programming languages." "The basic concurrency management objects in STING are first-class lightweight threads of control and virtual processors (VPS). Unlike high-level concurrency structures, STING threads and VPS are not encumbered by complex synchronization protocols. Threads and VPS are manip ulated in the same way es any other Scheme structure." "STING separates thread policy decisions from thread implementation ones. Implementations of different parallel languages built on top of STING can define their own scheduling and migration policies without requiring modification to the runtime system or the provided interface. Process migration and scheduling can be customized by applications on a per-VP basis." "The semantics and implementation of threads minimizes the cost of thread creation, and puts a premium on storage locality. The storage management policies in STING lead to better cache and page utilization, and allows users to experiment with a variety of different execution regimes - from fully delayed to completely eager evaluation.")

Schematic supports familiar constructs often used in typical parallel programs (future and higher-level macros such as plet and pbegin), which are actually defined atop a very small number of fundamental primitives. In this way, Schematic achieves both the convenience for typical concurrent programming and simplicity and exibility of the language kernel. Schematic also supports concurrent objects which exhibit more natural and intuitive behavior than the \"bare\" (unprotected) shared memory, and permit more concurrency than the traditional Actor model. Schematic will be useful for intensive parallel applications on parallel machines or networks of workstations, concurrent GUI programming, distributed programming over network, and even concurrent shell programming.")

(abstract "Parallel and distributed programs often have hardware/problem specific optimizations for improving quality of the program such as efficiency and robustness. Those optimizations, unfortunately, degrade portability and re-usability as they are intertwined with the original algorithm description. Reective languages, which provide the application programmer extensible and abstract implementation of the language, can describe such optimizations as extensions to the language. The separation of optimization descriptions gains portability and re-usability of both application programs and optimizations. However, the interpretive execution model of reective languages imposes a large amount of performance overhead, which sometimes outweighs bene- fits of optimizations. Previous reective languages prohibit some of operations being modified via reection, so as to reduce the amount of interpretation overhead. The imperfection of this approach is that it still leaves a considerable amount of overhead, and it yields less exible, unclear reective architecture." "This dissertation investigates design and compilation framework of metainterpreters and meta-objects in an object-oriented concurrent language ABCL/R3. By using partial evaluation to compile reective programs, ABCL/R3 achieves exible and lucid reective architecture and efficient execution at the same time. We design full-edged meta-interpreters by examining several concurrent programming examples. A newly proposed delegation mechanism enables to define modular and scope controlled extensions to meta-interpreters. We design meta-objects by exploiting the notion of reader/writer methods in a concurrent object-oriented language Schematic, so that they can be effectively partially evaluated. The compilation frameworks of meta-interpreters and meta-objects basically translate concurrent object definitions into a sequential program, then apply partial evaluator for a sequential language, and generates a program in a (non-reective) concurrent object-oriented language, in which base-level and meta-level objects are collapsed to single level objects. The efficiency of generated programs is demonstrated by several benchmark programs, in which our compiler exhibits performance close to non-reective languages.")

(abstract "Customizable meta-objects are a powerful abstraction for extending language features and implementation mechanisms, but interpretive execution suffers from severe performance penalty. Some of this penalty can be reduced by applying partial evaluation to meta-interpreters, but partial evaluation of meta-objects in existing concurrent object-oriented languages is ineffective. This paper proposes a new meta-object design for our reflective language ABCL/R3. It yields meta-objects that can be optimized effectively using partial evaluation. The crux of the design is the separation of state-related operations from other operations, and this separation is accomplished by using reader/writer methods in our concurrent object-oriented language called Schematic. Our benchmark trials show that non-trivial programs with partially evaluated meta-objects run more than six times faster than ones that are interpreted by meta-objects. In addition, a partially evaluated program that uses a customized meta-object runs as efficiently as a program that is manually rewritten so as to have the same functionality without using meta-objects.")

Engines are an abstraction of bounded computation, not a process abstraction in the usual sense. However, in conjuction with first class continuations, engines allow a language to be extended with time-sharing implementations for a variety of process abstraction facilities. We present a direct implementation of hiaton streams. Engine nesting refers to the initiation of an engine computation by an already running engine. We consider the need for engine nesting and show how it may be accomplished in a manner that charges a parent engine for the computation of its offspring. We conclude by discussing the importance of simple and general abstractions such as engines.")

This paper presents a new type of continuation, called a process continuation, that may be used to control tree-structured concurrency. Just as a traditional continuation represents the rest of a computation from a given point in the computation, a process continuation represents the rest of a subcomputation, or process, from a given point in the subcomputation. Process continuations allow nonlocal exits to arbitrary points in the process tree and allow the capture of a subtree of a computation as a composable continuation for later use. Even in the absence of multiple processes, the precise control achievable with process continuations makes them more useful than traditional continuations.")

(abstract "ABSTRACT: Any multiprocessing facility must include three features: elementary exclusion, data protection, and process saving. While elementary exclusion must rest on some hardware facility (e.g. a test-and-set instruction), the other two requirements are fulfilled by features already present in applicative languages. Data protection may be obtained through the use of procedures (closures or funargs), and process saving may be obtained through the use of the CATCH operator. The use of CATCH, in particular, allows an elegant treatment of process saving which is much more tractable than the ones found in the operating systems literature." "We demonstrate these techniques by writing the kernel and some modules for a multiprocessing system. The kernel is very small. Many functions which one would normally expect to find inside the kernel are completely decentralized. We consider the implementation of other schedulers, interrupts, and the implications of these ideas for language design.")

Just as a traditional continuation represents the rest of a computation from a given point in the computation, a subcontinuation represents the rest of a subcomputation from a given point in the subcomputation. Subcontinuations may be used to control tree-structured concurrency by allowing nonlocal exits to arbitrary points in a process tree and allowing the capture of a subtree of a computation as a composable continuation for later use. In the absence of concurrency the localized control achievable with subcontinuations makes them more useful than traditional continuations.")

(abstract "It is well known [Wand] that concurrency can be expressed within languages that provide a continuation type. However, a number of misconceptions persist regarding the relationship between threads and continuations. I discuss the proper relationship between these two objects, and present a model for directly expressing concurrency using continuations. The model is designed to support systems programming, and has several novel features: it is synchronous, preemptable, and fully virtualisable, allowing schedulers to be written by unprivileged users that are indistinguishable from top-level schedulers that actually control access to the hardware resources.")

Some programming languages provide the programmer with two facilities to act on the interpreter continuation: the capture and the invocation.

The invocation of a continuation discards the current interpreter continuation and resumes the computation with the invoked continuation." "The constructs fork and pcall explicitly indicate where parallel evaluations can proceed. These constructs are expected to be transparent: a program using such constructs is supposed to return the same result as in their absence.

This is the issue addressed in our dissertation, and these are its ma jor contributions."

(abstract "This thesis describes a high-performance implementation technique for Multilisp's \"future\" parallelism construct. This method addresses the non-uniform memory access (NUMA) problem inherent in large scale shared-memory multiprocessors. The technique is based on lazy task creation (LTC), a dynamic task partitioning mechanism that dramatically reduces the cost of task creation and consequently makes it possible to exploit fine grain parallelism. In LTC, idle processors get work to do by \"stealing\" tasks from other processors. A previously proposed implementation of LTC is the shared-memory (SM) protocol. The main disadvantage of the SM protocol is that it requires the stack to be cached suboptimally on cache-incoherent machines. This thesis proposes a new implementation technique for LTC that allows full caching of the stack: the message-passing (MP) protocol. Idle processors ask for work by sending \"work request\" messages to other processors. After receiving such a message a processor checks its private stack and task queue and sends back a task if one is available. The message passing protocol has the added benefits of a lower task creation cost and simpler algorithms. Extensive experiments evaluate the performance of both protocols on large shared-memory multiprocessors: a 90 processor GP1000 and a 32 processor TC2000. The results show that the MP protocol is consistently better than the SM protocol. The difference in performance is as high as a factor of two when a cache is available and a factor of 1.2 when a cache is not available. In addition, the thesis shows that the semantics of the Multilisp language does not have to be impoverished to attain good performance. The laziness of LTC can be exploited to support at virtually no cost several programming features including: the Katz-Weise continuation semantics with legitimacy, dynamic scoping, and fairness.")

Indeed, unrestricted parallelism and rst-class continuations may lead to non-deterministic programs, which is contradictory to the notion of annotation.

Prior research on futures has concentrated on implementation and design issues, and has largely ignored the development of a semantic characterization of futures. This paper presents four operational semantics for an idealized functional language with futures with varying degrees of intensionality. The first semantics defines future to be a semantically-transparent annotation. The second semantics interprets a future expression as a potentially parallel task. The third semantics explicates the coordination of parallel tasks and the need for touch operations on placeholder-strict arguments to certain primitive operations by introducing placeholder objects. The fourth and last semantics is a low-level refinement of the third semantics, which explicates just enough information to permit the smooth derivation of program analyses. The paper includes proofs showing the equivalence of these semantics.")

To support communication among terminable tasks, language run-time systems (and operating systems) provide kill-safe abstractions for inter-task communication. No kill-safe guarantee is available, however, for abstractions that are implemented outside the run-time system." "In this paper, we show how a run-time system can support new kill-safe abstractions without requiring modification to the run-time system, and without requiring the run-time system to trust any new code. Our design frees the run-time implementor to provide only a modest set of synchronization primitives in the trusted computing base, while still allowing tasks to communicate using sophisticated abstractions.")

Using two realistic data sets, we compare a previous sequential version of the program written in Miranda to the new sequential and parallel versions written in C, Scheme, and Multilisp, and explain how these new versions were designed to attain good absolute performance. Critical issues were the performance of floating-point operations, garbage collection, load balancing, and contention for shared data. We found that speedup was dependent on the data set. For the first data set, nearly linear speedup was observed for up to 64 processors whereas for the second the speedup was limited to a factor of 16.")

In contrast, we propose a task distribution method based on a message passing paradigm. Its main advantages are that it is simpler to implement, has a lower cost for locally run tasks, and allows full caching of the stack on cache incoherent machines. Benchmarks on a 32 processor BBN TC2000 show that our method is more efficient than the original implementation by as much as a factor of 2.")

PVM conveys high-level information bidirectionally between the machine-independent front end of the compiler and the machine-dependent back end, making it easy to implement a number of common back end optimizations that are difficult to achieve for other virtual machines."

(abstract "Parallel symbolic algorithms exhibit characteristics that make their efficient implementation on current multiprocessor platforms difficult: data is generated dynamically and often have irregular shape and density, data sets typically consist of objects of many different types and structure, the natural unit of concurrency is often much smaller than can be efficiently supported on stock hardware, efficient scheduling, migration and load-balancing strategies vary widely among different algorithms, and sensible decomposition of the program into parallel threads of control often cannot be achieved by mere examination of the source text.")

(abstract "Abstract interpretation has been long regarded as a promising optimization and analysis technique for high-level languages. In this article, we describe an implementation of a concurrent abstract interpreter. The interpreter evaluates programs written in an expressive parallel language that supports dynamic process creation, first-class locations, list data structures and higher-order procedures. Synchronization in the input language is mediated via first-class shared locations. The analysis computes intra- and inter-thread control and dataflow information." "The interpreter is implemented on top of Sting, a multi-threaded dialect of Scheme that serves as a high-level operating system for modern programming languages")

(abstract "We describe an analysis of a parallel language in which processes communicate via rst-class mutable shared locations. The sequential core of the language de nes a higher-order strict functional language with list data structures. The parallel extensions permit processes and shared locations to be dynamically created; synchronization among processes occurs exclusively via shared locations." "The analysis is de ned by an abstract interpretation on this language. The interpretation is efficient and useful, facilitating a number of important optimizations related to synchronization, processor/thread mapping, and storage management.")
